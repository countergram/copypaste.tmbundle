Replaces copy, cut, and paste in TextMate using commands bound to Cmd-C, Cmd-X, and Cmd-V.

Pasted indented blocks will now "start" at the cursor's indentation rather than what TextMate thinks is the next appropriate indent. This is very useful for, among other things, Python programming.

INSTALLATION

cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
git clone git://github.com/countergram/copypaste.tmbundle.git
